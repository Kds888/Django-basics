# this contains all the information about how to deploy the website on the internet 
# requirements:-
# Need to be able to push updates to our code and have version control[ this is for the cloud server which we are trying to upload our file to ]
# cloud service provider
# Often there is a trade of f between ease of use and price
# there is a link on the course hoem page for 100$ through perian data
# www.linode.com/Ip/try/?ifso=pierian
# to maintain the version we use git  and will use github to store our code 

# github will be connected with our server at linode, so as to push code easily 

# In market place we select the django and we fill in the form for django options 

# once watch the django deplymnet video on Linode 

# SSH connection [secure shell]

# it allow us to securely connect to the linode server that is hosting our django project
# it will require the password that we will set up in our initial process 
# it's just a way to connect our computer to the linode computer through security 
# just point to the computer IP address and conform the passwrod 
# once we connect through SSH we will have the access to debiam linux shell located at our linode server 
# this means we will be able to use linux commands at the terminal for installation and setups 
# refer to documnetation on linode connection to ssh
# install open ssh client on windows 
# go to optional features in search bar of your windows and find open ssh client if not installed install it 
# and then head to pwer shell 
# we need to go to the c/ drive in power shell and then head to windows and then to system 32 and then to open ssh 
# and we need to run ./ssh root@your ip address of the linode
# and then say yes and enter the password 


# Version control with Git And GITHUB...

# we will set it up so that we can update our code in our website with any code we have updated on github
